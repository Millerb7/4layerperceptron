    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, you will compare the performance of multi-layer perceptrons with your own implementations. This project is a crucial component of the course, constituting 10% of the final grade. Teams are required to submit a comprehensive report in a Jupyter notebook format, including all code, visualizations, and narratives. For visualizations that cannot be directly embedded, include screenshots. Ensure the results are reproducible using the submitted notebook.\n"

    "## Dataset Selection\n",
    "You will employ the US Census data for this assignment, specifically chosen by the instructor. This dataset is available on Kaggle and can also be downloaded from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bf7i7qjftk7cmzq/acs2017_census_tract_data.csv?dl=0). The classification task involves predicting the child poverty rate across different tracts, requiring you to convert this into a four-level classification task by quantizing the variable of interest."
