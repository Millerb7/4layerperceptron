    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, you will compare the performance of multi-layer perceptrons with your own implementations. This project is a crucial component of the course, constituting 10% of the final grade. Teams are required to submit a comprehensive report in a Jupyter notebook format, including all code, visualizations, and narratives. For visualizations that cannot be directly embedded, include screenshots. Ensure the results are reproducible using the submitted notebook.\n"

This dataset is available on Kaggle and can also be downloaded from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bf7i7qjftk7cmzq/acs2017_census_tract_data.csv?dl=0). The classification task involves predicting the child poverty rate across different tracts, requiring you to convert this into a four-level classification task by quantizing the variable of interest.\n",
